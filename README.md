# Build pipeline for hydroforecast tools on Windows 

This is a draft build pipline for hydroforecast software tools for windows, mostly SWIFT2.

## 

[Microsoft hosted agents](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/hosted?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml) lists what is available. Only recent versions of VStudio are available (fair enough). Not sure this is worth sticking to VS 2013 anymore really.

Should we revive building with cmake on windows rather than using our custom curated .vcproj files?
